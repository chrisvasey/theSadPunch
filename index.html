  A short story..
</h3>
<p class="sobStory">
  Once upon a time, there was a sad little bowl of punch. He was only some juice and a tiny splash of gin, barely enough for a sip. Day after day he watched other punches rising to levels of greatness he could only dream of, and day after day he was saddened by his own failure. <br>
  "If only there was some way I could be better!" He cried.
  <br>
  Suddenly, with a blinding flash of light, a figure appeared before him. <br>
  "Who are you?" Asked the punch, quaking in fear.
  "I am Chris, little punch. I have had visions for your future. Visions of you being the centrepiece of my bed race party and making everybody merry. Will you join me on this journey?" The punch thought this sounded wonderful, but was still upset. <br>
  "How will this happen Chris? I am only a little bowl of punch, not worthy of a great party like the one you speak of." At this, Chris smiled.
  "I have done it once before, little punch. I have called on the bank accounts of my friends and they have answered. I have delved into the depths of their student overdrafts and withdrawn sufficient alcohol funds. I have seen a new year brought in bathed in alcohol and skittles. And I will see it done once more." 
  <br>
  And with that glorious statement, Chris turned and broke the fourth wall. <br>
  "Now it is your turn, dear readers! Click the button below and give me money for punch."

  there once was a punch bowl named ted <br>
  who loved being strawberry red <br>
  his owners were poor, and ran out the door, <br>
  when he said he was racing a bed <br>
  <br>
  we have no money they said to ted <br>
  and no liquor to make you strawberry red <br>
  we sorry but no, we do love you so <br>
  but you cannot go racing a bed <br>
  <br>
  please spare a moment for poor teds cause <br>
  all he wants is to be there to see the applause <br>
  he'll always be loud, and sit up so proud <br>
  providing drink and fun without pause <br>
  <br>
  to help ted see the wonderful race <br>
  and to put a smile on his little red face <br>
  donations required, his punch has expired! <br>
  he'll respond with his warmest embrace  <br>
